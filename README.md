### Project Description:
In our daily lives, there are so many habits we can change everyday from being more aware of the foods we buy at the grocery store and where they come from to utilizing public transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. When we explored the food supply, energy, and transportation sectors, we displayed various visualizations in order to help our audience craft a personalized understanding of how global warming impacts the planet.

We all have a role to play in order to take steps to combat global warming. We hope these visualizations serve as the first step to help you better understand where emissions come from and consider changes YOU can make to reduce emissions today and in the future. Let's stick to PLAN A, because there is no PLANet B.
